    The Digital Gold Institute is a center for research, development, teaching,
    consultancy, and advisoring about scarsity in digital domain (bitcoin and 
    crypto-assets) and the underlying blockchain technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    We explore the foundations and can assist you in understanding them:
    cryptography, game theory,
    networking and data trasmission, economic and monetary teory.
    We love to get our hands dirty in the programming and technology fields,
    engaging in a productive journey with our partners.

    Bitcoin has proved to be a bearer asset that
    can be transferred but not duplicated
    (i.e. it can be spent, but not double-spent).
    Scarce in digital realm as nothing else before,
    Bitcoin is digital gold with an embedded settlement network.
    More a crypto-commodity then a crypto-currency, bitcoin
    aims to be a world reserve asset.
  </p>

    If one thinks about the role of physical gold in the history
    of civilization, money, and finance
    the digital equivalent of gold could be disruptive
    in the current digital civilization and the future of money and finance.

    Bitcoin is the groundbreaking achievement by Satoshi Nakamoto,
    not the generic _blockchain technology_.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Blockchain 
    is just an append-only sequential data structure: new blocks
    (of transactions) can be appended at the end of the chain,
    to change a block in the middle of the chain
    all subsequent blocks need to be changed. As such, it is
    very inefficient compared to a relational database.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Blockchain requires an intrinsic native digital asset
    to solve the double-spending problem, i.e. to reward
    the so called _miners_ (the blockchain back-office).
    A blockchain without such an asset ultimately needs
    to appoint its back-office operators, resorting to 
    some kind of central governance. If this is the case
    why use a blockchain, i.e. a subpar data structure,
    instead of an efficient relational database?

    Anyway, as Andreas Antonopoulos said,
    _there is no blockchain without bitcoin, but there is blockchain beyond bitcoin_:
    timestamping and notarization.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A generic data file can be hashed to produce a short unique identifier,
    equivalent to its digital fingerprint.
    Such a fingerprint can be associated to a bitcoin transaction (of irrelevant amount)
    and hence registered on the blockchain.
    Blockchain immutability provides time-stamping, proving the data file
    existence at that moment in time in that specific status.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A single transaction can timestamp an unlimited number of documents:
    the process has been <a href="https://www.opentimestamps.org">standardized</a>
    to allow for third party auditability
    and it is suitable for regulatory prescriptions. What jewelry is for gold,
    notarization is for bitcoin: not essential,
    but effective at leveraging its beauty.
