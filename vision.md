Bitcoin has proved to be a bearer digital asset that can be transferred but not
duplicated (i.e. it can be spent, but not double-spent). Scarce in
digital realm as nothing else before, bitcoin is digital gold with an
embedded settlement network. More a crypto-commodity then a crypto-currency,
bitcoin aims to be a world reserve asset.

If one thinks about the role of physical gold in the history of civilization,
money, and finance the digital equivalent of gold could be disruptive in the
current digital civilization and the future of money and finance.
Bitcoin is the groundbreaking achievement by Satoshi Nakamoto, not the
so-called _blockchain technology_.

Blockchain is just an append-only sequential data structure:
new blocks (of transactions) can be appended at the end of the chain,
to change a block in the middle of the chain all subsequent blocks need
to be changed. As such, it is very inefficient compared to a
relational database.

Blockchain requires an intrinsic native digital asset to solve the
double-spending problem, i.e. to provide the economic incentives
for the so-called _miners_ (the blockchain back-office) to be honest.
A blockchain without such an asset
needs to select and appoint its back-office operators, ultimately resorting
to central governance. If this is the case why use a blockchain,
i.e. a subpar data structure, instead of an efficient relational database?

There is no blockchain without bitcoin; anyway, as Andreas Antonopoulos said,
_there is blockchain beyond bitcoin_: timestamping and notarization.

A generic data file can be _hashed_ to produce a short unique identifier,
equivalent to its digital fingerprint. Such a fingerprint can be associated
to a bitcoin transaction (of irrelevant amount) and hence registered on the
blockchain. Blockchain immutability provides time-stamping, proving the data
file existence at that moment in time in that specific status.

A single transaction can timestamp an unlimited number of documents:
the process has been [standardized](https://www.opentimestamps.org/)
to allow for third party auditability and it is suitable for regulatory
prescriptions. What jewelry is for gold, notarization is for bitcoin:
not essential, but effective at leveraging its beauty.

Last but not least, when it comes to non-monetary applications for blockchain
we believe that the most promising field is tech and tools for
financial services, primarily crypto-assets custody for institutionals and
high net worth individuals with funds under management.
